## The performance

In October 2024, the Dordts Zuigkwintet will play a theater performance about the Dordrecht market in Door. Everyone has a bond with the weekly market. We regard the market as a metaphor for a beloved Dordrecht resident. Someone who benefits you, who you can talk to, who is your friend.

In the theater piece 'De Dordtse Markt' we sympathize with market master Johan, Greet from the flower stall In Duigen, Jo Bintje from the Hoeksche Aardappelen Kraam, Boy Bodyfashion from the Textielkraam and Tom Anders, the coffee deliverer.

Sleepless nights, entrepreneurs in tears and reproaches to the market master. These are troubled days for stand holders. A new policy is coming, which makes the future for local market stallholders uncertain. In addition to all this, there are personal themes and it all comes together in this tragicomedy with a laugh and a tear.
